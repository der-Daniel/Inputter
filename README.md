# Idea
Most popular websites have a big, bold search bar at the top of their website. Google, YouTube or Amazon are just a few examples of such a kind.  
Imagine you have entered a keyword and scroll through the results as you notice you need to change your keyword or you want to start a complete new search. Neither way, you would need to scroll all the way up and click on the search bar. ***Nobody got time for that***

### Use Inputter to focus this input field.
Inputter crawls the website and looks for the first reasonable input text field. This approach holds for many websites like: YouTube, Google, Amazon, Twitter, GitHub, Reddit, Facebook, dict, Linguee and many more.
